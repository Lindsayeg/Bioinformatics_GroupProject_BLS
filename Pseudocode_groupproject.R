#Pseudocode to translate nucleotide sequences to aminoacid sequences

#Read the aa sequence file - codonmap.txt file
#Read the nucleotide fasta files control 1&2 and obsese 1&2
#Translate nucleotide fasta files into aa fasta files
#Reading the nucleotide fasta into aa fasta - start with startcodon and end at first stopcodon - use sed?(manual?)
